# Automotive Shift Planning Enhancements

## Introduction

This specification outlines enhancements to transform the Shiftwise Workforce Planning System into a specialized automotive manufacturing shift planning application. The enhancements focus on automotive industry branding, comprehensive station management, and persistent planning board state to better serve automotive manufacturing environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automotive Branding and UI Theme

**User Story:** As a manufacturing manager, I want the application to have an automotive industry look and feel so that it aligns with our manufacturing environment and feels purpose-built for automotive production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display an automotive-themed logo and branding
2. WHEN users navigate the interface THEN the color scheme SHALL reflect automotive manufacturing (blues, grays, industrial colors)
3. WHEN viewing the application THEN terminology SHALL be automotive-specific (Production Lines, Manufacturing Stations, Shift Teams)
4. WHEN accessing the favicon THEN it SHALL represent automotive manufacturing
5. WHEN viewing page titles and headers THEN they SHALL use automotive manufacturing terminology

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Station Management

**User Story:** As a production supervisor, I want to manage manufacturing stations and define staffing requirements so that I can ensure proper coverage for each production line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing station management THEN I SHALL see a dedicated Stations page with CRUD operations
2. WHEN creating a new station THEN I SHALL be able to define:
   - Station name and description
   - Production line assignment
   - Required number of employees per shift slot
   - Required skills and certifications
3. WHEN editing a station THEN I SHALL be able to modify all station properties including staffing levels
4. WHEN viewing stations THEN I SHALL see current staffing status and requirements
5. WHEN deleting a station THEN the system SHALL warn about existing assignments and handle cleanup properly

### Requirement 3: Multiple Employee Assignment per Station Slot

**User Story:** As a shift planner, I want to assign multiple employees to a single station slot so that I can meet the staffing requirements for each production station.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the planning board THEN each slot SHALL show the required vs assigned employee count
2. WHEN dragging an employee to a slot THEN it SHALL add to existing assignments if capacity allows
3. WHEN a slot is at capacity THEN it SHALL visually indicate no more assignments are possible
4. WHEN a slot is understaffed THEN it SHALL show warning indicators
5. WHEN removing an employee THEN other employees SHALL remain assigned to the slot
6. WHEN viewing slot details THEN I SHALL see all assigned employees with their roles

### Requirement 4: Persistent Planning Board State

**User Story:** As a shift planner, I want my planning board assignments to persist when navigating between pages so that I don't lose my work in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making assignments on the planning board THEN they SHALL be automatically saved to the backend
2. WHEN navigating away from the planning board THEN assignments SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN returning to the planning board THEN all previous assignments SHALL be restored
4. WHEN the browser is refreshed THEN the current planning state SHALL be maintained
5. WHEN assignments are made THEN they SHALL be synchronized with the database immediately
6. WHEN there are save errors THEN the user SHALL be notified and given retry options

### Requirement 5: Automotive-Specific Navigation and Terminology

**User Story:** As a manufacturing user, I want the navigation and interface terminology to reflect automotive manufacturing so that the system feels familiar and industry-appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing navigation menus THEN they SHALL use automotive manufacturing terms:
   - "Production Lines" instead of generic stations
   - "Manufacturing Teams" instead of generic employees
   - "Shift Planning" instead of generic scheduling
2. WHEN viewing page headers THEN they SHALL reflect automotive context
3. WHEN viewing help text and labels THEN they SHALL use automotive manufacturing terminology
4. WHEN viewing the main dashboard THEN it SHALL be titled appropriately for automotive production
5. WHEN accessing different sections THEN the breadcrumbs SHALL use automotive terminology
