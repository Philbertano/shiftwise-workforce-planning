# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ShiftWise is an AI-assisted workforce planning system designed to automate shift scheduling for production environments. The system addresses the challenges of manual shift planning by considering employee qualifications, availability, vacation/sick leave, and labor compliance rules. It provides shift leaders and HR planners with automated staffing proposals that can be reviewed and confirmed, resulting in better coverage, fewer rule violations, and complete transparency in the planning process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a shift leader, I want to automatically generate shift plans based on employee qualifications and availability, so that I can reduce planning time and minimize coverage gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shift leader selects a date and shift template THEN the system SHALL generate staffing proposals within 3 seconds for up to 200 employees across 10 stations
2. WHEN generating proposals THEN the system SHALL ensure all hard constraints are met (skill requirements, availability, labor law compliance)
3. WHEN no valid assignment exists for a station THEN the system SHALL mark it as a coverage gap and rank gaps by criticality
4. IF multiple valid candidates exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on fairness, preferences, and continuity scoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an HR planner, I want to maintain employee qualifications and track absences, so that the system can make accurate staffing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing employee data THEN the system SHALL store qualifications with skill levels (1-3) and expiry dates
2. WHEN an absence is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate against existing assignments and show conflicts
3. WHEN qualifications expire THEN the system SHALL highlight expiring certificates in the qualification matrix
4. IF an employee lacks required skills THEN the system SHALL exclude them from station assignments requiring those skills

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a shift leader, I want to view coverage status across all stations and shifts, so that I can identify risks and take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the planning board THEN the system SHALL display a coverage heatmap with green (â‰¥100%), yellow (90-99%), and red (<90%) indicators
2. WHEN coverage falls below requirements THEN the system SHALL show gap details with criticality rankings
3. WHEN assignments are proposed THEN the system SHALL highlight differences from current assignments
4. IF hard rule violations exist THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and display violation details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a shift leader, I want to simulate "what-if" scenarios, so that I can understand the impact of changes before committing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting a simulation THEN the system SHALL allow toggling employee absences and recalculate coverage
2. WHEN running simulations THEN the system SHALL show risk calculations and coverage impact
3. WHEN comparing scenarios THEN the system SHALL highlight changes in assignments and coverage levels
4. IF simulation results show critical gaps THEN the system SHALL suggest mitigation options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a shift leader, I want explanations for all assignments, so that I can understand and trust the AI recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an assignment is proposed THEN the system SHALL provide explanations including skill match, availability, and fairness considerations
2. WHEN reviewing proposals THEN the system SHALL show why specific employees were selected over alternatives
3. WHEN constraints conflict THEN the system SHALL explain trade-offs and prioritization decisions
4. IF assignments seem suboptimal THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind the choices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all labor law constraints enforced, so that the organization remains compliant with regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating assignments THEN the system SHALL enforce maximum hours per day limits
2. WHEN scheduling consecutive shifts THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum rest periods between shifts
3. WHEN calculating weekly hours THEN the system SHALL respect contract-based weekly hour limits
4. IF any labor law violation would occur THEN the system SHALL reject the assignment and flag the violation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want complete audit trails of all planning decisions, so that I can track changes and ensure accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any assignment is created, modified, or deleted THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and user
2. WHEN plans are committed THEN the system SHALL record the final assignments and approval details
3. WHEN viewing audit logs THEN the system SHALL show chronological history of all planning activities
4. IF disputes arise THEN the system SHALL provide complete traceability of decision-making process

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a shift leader, I want to manage shift templates and station requirements, so that I can adapt to changing operational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating shift templates THEN the system SHALL allow defining start time, end time, and break rules
2. WHEN configuring stations THEN the system SHALL support multiple required skills with minimum levels and counts
3. WHEN updating requirements THEN the system SHALL validate existing assignments against new criteria
4. IF requirement changes affect current plans THEN the system SHALL highlight impacted assignments

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system user, I want role-based access control, so that sensitive planning data is protected and users can only perform authorized actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate via OIDC and assign appropriate roles
2. WHEN accessing planning functions THEN the system SHALL verify user has planner or shift leader permissions
3. WHEN managing employee data THEN the system SHALL restrict access to HR and admin roles
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a shift leader, I want to commit approved plans and track their execution, so that assignments become official and can be monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing proposals THEN the system SHALL allow selective approval of individual assignments
2. WHEN committing plans THEN the system SHALL change assignment status from 'proposed' to 'confirmed'
3. WHEN plans are committed THEN the system SHALL update coverage calculations and remove gaps
4. IF last-minute changes occur THEN the system SHALL support quick re-planning with minimal disruption

## CRITICAL MISSING FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different modules of the application, so that I can access all functionality including employee management and qualification matrix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL provide a navigation menu with links to all modules
2. WHEN clicking navigation links THEN the system SHALL route to the appropriate page/component
3. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL show current location and allow navigation to other sections
4. IF a component exists THEN it SHALL be accessible through the navigation system

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As an HR manager, I want to add, edit, and delete employees, so that I can maintain an accurate workforce database.

2. WHEN editing employee information THEN the system SHALL update the database and reflect changes in all related components
3. WHEN deleting an employee THEN the system SHALL remove them from the database and handle any existing assignments
4. IF searching for employees THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities

### Requirement 13

**User Story:** As a shift leader, I want to define staffing requirements for each shift and station, so that the automatic assignment algorithm can work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a shift THEN the system SHALL allow setting minimum and maximum employee counts per station
2. WHEN defining station requirements THEN the system SHALL support specifying required skills and minimum proficiency levels
3. WHEN generating assignments THEN the system SHALL use these requirements to determine appropriate staffing
4. IF requirements are not met THEN the system SHALL identify coverage gaps and suggest solutions
